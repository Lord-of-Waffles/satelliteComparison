This Project for Junction 2024 allows a user to compare 2 different satellite images from their selected dates at their selected coordinates.

The website is built with react and uses several 3rd party components.

To run the project:

You need to have Node.js installed, and run these commands in the project folder:



npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

npm install @mui/icons-material

npm install @mui/x-date-pickers

npm install dayjs

npm install react-leaflet leaflet

npm install react-compare-slider

Then use the command npm run dev to start the project

N.B! It may take up to 20 seconds to load the satellite images! Once you click submit, the images begin to be requested from the APIs
